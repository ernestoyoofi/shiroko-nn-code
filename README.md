# Shiroko Nn Morse Code

A meme that shiroko always says “Nn” in a chat or in a conversation, this project is only used for fun.

## How it works?

In the script section, when translating, there are parts that are not visible, this is because it uses special characters, namely unicode with the name zero width space (\u200B) and zero width non-joiner (\u200C), in converting, usually from text is converted to ahcii and changes in binary form, namely 0 and 1, after that it is converted to unicode which can hide the message.
